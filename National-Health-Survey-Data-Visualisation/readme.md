# 📊 Data Visualization Project: All India and State/UT-wise Factsheets of National Family Health Survey (NFHS) - 5, 2019-2021

## 📚 Introduction
This Jupyter Notebook project focuses on visualizing data from the National Family Health Survey (NFHS) - 5, conducted between 2019-2021. The project utilizes various libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to explore, analyze, and visualize the provided dataset.

### 📂 Source Dataset
The source dataset used for this project is "All India and State/UT-wise Factsheets of National Family Health Survey (NFHS) - 5, 2019-2021." You can access the dataset [here](https://data.gov.in/catalog/national-family-health-survey-nfhs-5).

## 🛠️ Libraries Used
- **NumPy**: Used for numerical computations and data manipulation.
- **Pandas**: Utilized for data analysis, manipulation, and handling.
- **Matplotlib**: Employed for creating static, interactive, and dynamic visualizations.
- **Seaborn**: Used for statistical data visualization and enhancing Matplotlib plots.

## 📊 Project Overview
The project involves:
- Data loading and preprocessing using Pandas.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the NFHS dataset.
- Creating various visualizations such as histograms, bar plots, scatter plots, and more to represent different aspects of the data.
- Conducting statistical analysis and drawing meaningful conclusions from the visualized data.

## 🌍 Real-World Application
Understanding health-related data at both national and state/UT levels is crucial for policymakers, healthcare professionals, and researchers. This project's visualizations can provide valuable insights into various health metrics, enabling informed decision-making and resource allocation.

### 🎯 Goals:
- **Data Exploration**: Visualize key health indicators across different states/UTs.
- **Insights Generation**: Extract meaningful patterns and correlations from the data.
- **Communication of Findings**: Present findings through effective visualizations for easy understanding.

## 💬 How to Use the Notebooks
To explore and interact with the visualizations:
1. Clone the repository or download the Jupyter Notebook files.
2. Install the required libraries if not already installed (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn).
3. Open the Jupyter Notebooks in your local environment (e.g., Jupyter Notebook, JupyterLab).
4. Execute the cells to run the code and generate the visualizations.
5. Interact with the visualizations to analyze different aspects of the NFHS data.
